# Codes_for_TIE

This repository contains the code for the paper: "Resilient Real-Time Decision-Making for Autonomous Mobile Robot Path Planning in Complex Dynamic Environments"

## DRL
DRL includes the core code for the state and reward design of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm.
Our DRL training environment is modified based on open-source project https://github.com/tomasvr/turtlebot3_drlnav.

DRL also includes the core code of the pure pursuit algorithm.
